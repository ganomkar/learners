# Conclusion

In this guide, we have created a Spring Boot application that performs create, update, and delete operations on a cache. We also implemented BDD style tests using Cucumber with feature files and step definitions in Java. This setup uses example of e-commerce application with well-defined behavior-driven tests.

By following these steps, you will have a fully functional Spring Boot application with caching and BDD tests, ready for further enhancements and deployment.
